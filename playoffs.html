<h1>How the NASCAR Playoffs are structured</h1>
<p>For all three NASCAR national series, there are a series of eliminations as the NASCAR Playoffs progress. This culminates in the series finales, where the Championship 4 drivers race “straight-up” for the title — the first to cross the line of the four championship-eligible drivers is crowned the champion. This year’s championship weekend is Nov. 8-10 at Phoenix Raceway.</p>
<h1>How NASCAR drivers get to the playoffs</h1>
<p>“Win and you’re in.” Championship-eligible drivers who won a race during the regular season qualify for the playoffs. If there are fewer unique race winners than open spots in the playoffs, the remaining positions are filled based on regular-season points.</p>
<h1>NASCAR Playoffs Round-by-round</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>16 drivers, four rounds</li>
        <li>Playoffs begin at Darlington Raceway (Aug. 6)</li>
        <li>Elimination races, where four drivers are eliminated from the playoffs: Bristol Motor Speedway (Sept. 13), Charlotte Motor Speedway Roval (Oct. 5), Martinsville Speedway (Oct. 26)</li>
    </ul>
<h1>How Does the NASCAR Point System Work</h1>
<p>Throughout the NASCAR regular season, drivers earn playoff points to be used in the postseason. The playoff points procedure continues in the playoffs for drivers who remain in contention.</p>
<h2>How drivers earn playoff points</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Win Stage 1 or Stage 2 in a race: 1 playoff point (point awarded per stage win)</li>
    <li>Win a race: 5 playoff points</li>
    <li>Win the regular-season championship: 15 playoff points</li>
</ul>

<p>Second place in the final regular-season standings earns 10 playoff points, third place receives eight points, and the points awarded decline to one point for 10th (fourth = seven points, fifth = six points, etc.).</p>
<br>
<p>Championship-contending drivers can accumulate additional playoff points throughout the playoffs via stage and race wins and may use all the playoff points they earn, from both the regular season and the playoffs, to advance all the way up to the Championship 4.</p>
<br>
<p>Playoff points are added to a championship-contending driver’s reset points total at the start of every round of the NASCAR Playoffs until they are eliminated from championship contention.</p>
<br>
<p>If a driver accumulates playoff points during the regular season but does not qualify for the playoffs, their playoff points are eliminated from the scoreboard.</p>
<br>
<p>At Phoenix Raceway, playoff points are off the table and the Championship 4 drivers enter the “winner-take-all” race on equal ground.</p>
