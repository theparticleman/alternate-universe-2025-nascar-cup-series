  <h1>Season Summary</h1>
  <h3><a href="/alternate-universe-2025-nascar-cup-series/races/clash.html">Clash</a></h3>
<p>Trimble was 32nd fastest in 1st practice, 35th fastest in 2nd practice, and 5th fastest in 3rd practice. He started 2nd in Heat 2, in which he finished 6th and just outside of the final transfer spot and did not advance to the main event. At the last chance qualifier, Trimble started on the pole. He led the first 26 laps. Melissa Nelson was charging aggresively through the field, wrecking Aaron Kirz in the process bringing out a caution that bunched the field up again. Nelson eventually caught up to Trimble and passed him for the lead. Despite the leader eventually wrecking, Trimble had to fight other desperate drivers including Kasen Kelander, and ended up finishing 5th and again just outside of the final transfer spot (2nd place). However, in the main event, close friend <a href="/bios/bioTyNichols.html">Ty Nichols</a> won the race and dedicated his win to DC for his qualifying efforts.</p>
<h3><a href="/alternate-universe-2025-nascar-cup-series/races/daytona500.html">Daytona 500</a></h3>
  <p>Trimble was 16th fastest in qualifying. He started 8th in Duel 2.</p>
